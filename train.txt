Doppleganger 
Kinda pervy

The 4th is the thickest than other parts of Harry potter
I read all of em
It has about 800 pages
VyomYesterday at 6:18 PM
I have a bad feeling about this
Hahaha
Shoot em!
Piu piu piu!
I am talking about the sound of the bullet or rather huge bullet
Boom! Boom!
The tank gets destroyed
Can we get some f in the chat for the tank
F
don't u see DANI
TRAINING MY BOT WITH 3 MILLION DIALOGUES
let's see how it goes
let's hope for the best
huh
whaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
in 2 mins
Ooooh! That!
I used to
yea :rofl:
:rofl:
hmm i still do
but he have started dani clips
kinda abandoned devlogs
AH im not at all in the preference with the suggestion
cause the person might know , when he'll lose
also it a depends on his credentials
like a person with 2000 credits might bet 500
but a person with 100000 credjts will bet atleast 5000
Yeah.... That's what I am saying
so we cam't make it random
If I say .slots 100 even if I have 20000 then you can chose a random num between 100 and 0
You getting me?
oo
gotcha
The result can be added to his credits
but i shud have a range option
Yeah
like if i have 100000
then i wouldn't like to win 50 right
but im not sure if that'd work
But that's fate
let's see who all r with ur suggestion
50 is better than 0
Right?
fuck you
you mother fucking asshole
i like abusing you
'cause you create nuisance
don't repeat stuff
i will kill you
die 
everyone go check out #sugge
Why did you down vote it
You did not like it?
cause i ain't in favour completely
Then don't vote it at all......
No offense
k
donex
Np..... No offense....... Kay?
You can vote if you want to.....
ahm not sure if that'd be right
so i will go with the popular votes
Definition of a Mess

Kids I'm gonna tell you
An incredible story;
The story of how
I met your mother.
Are we being punished for something?
No.
Yeah is this gonna take a while?
Yes. 25 years ago before I was dad
I had this whole other life.
It was way back in 2005.
I was 27 just starting to make it as an architect
And living in new york with marshall
My best friend from college.
My life was good.
And then uncle marshall went and screwed the whole thing up.
Will you marry me?
Yes.
Perfect And then you're engaged.
You pop the champagne. You drink a toast.
You have sex on the kitchen floor.
Don't have sex on our kitchen floor.
Got it.
Thanks for helping me plan this out .
Dude are you kidding?
I've been there for all the big moments of you and lilly:
Night you met
Your first date other first things.
Yeah sorry.
We thought you were asleep.
It physics marshall.
If the bottom bunk moves the top bunk moves too.
My god.
You're getting engaged tonight.
Yeah.
What are you doin' tonight?
What was I doing?
Here uncle marshall was taking the biggest step of his life.
I'm calling up your uncle .
Hey so you know how I've always had a thing
For half-asian girls?

woow u also got nitro?
nah
its gif
okay
.react
https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/798795579819294740.gif?size=40
why is it not adding roles
show code
```py

        
    @commands.Cog.listener()
    async def on_reaction_add(self,reaction, user):
        Channel = self.client.get_channel(817631069364420648)
        if reaction.message.channel.id != Channel:
            return
        if reaction.emoji == "<:c_:817634223665840139>":
            Role = discord.utils.get(user.server.roles, name="C# Helper")
            await self.client.add_roles(user, Role)
        elif reaction.emoji == "<:python:788793286827180042>":
            Role = discord.utils.get(user.server.roles, name="Python Helper")
            await self.client.add_roles(user, Role)
        elif reaction.emoji == ":musical_note:":
            Role = discord.utils.get(user.server.roles, name="Music Addicts")
            await self.client.add_roles(user, Role)
        elif reaction.emoji == "<:javascript:789078580818083872>":
            Role = discord.utils.get(user.server.roles, name="JavaScript Helper")
            await self.client.add_roles(user, Role)
        elif reaction.emoji == "<:html_css:789078584479186985>":
            Role = discord.utils.get(user.server.roles, name="Html and Css Helper")
            await self.client.add_roles(user, Role)
```
well I suggest using `on_raw_reaction_add` event
make it `if reaction.message.id == id`
okay
but why
then do i put the emote id?
<:name:id>
ok...
this one
wait what is message here
.react
this is message
ahhh
m sayin that it'd say that message is not defined
why
oh
well I suggest try
ahhh
it's a on_reaction func
well i can say that reaction.message.id
yes
ok
so let's see
.react
noice
didn't wor
show new code
```py

    @commands.Cog.listener()
    async def on_reaction_add(self,reaction, user):
        Channel = self.client.get_channel(817631069364420648)
        if reaction.message.channel.id != Channel:
            return
        if reaction.message.id == ":c_:":
            Role = discord.utils.get(user.server.roles, name="C# Helper")
            await self.client.add_roles(user, Role)
        elif reaction.message.id == ":python:":
            Role = discord.utils.get(user.server.roles, name="Python Helper")
            await self.client.add_roles(user, Role)
        elif reaction.message.id == ":musical_note:":
            Role = discord.utils.get(user.server.roles, name="Music Addicts")
            await self.client.add_roles(user, Role)
        elif reaction.message.id == ":javascript:":
            Role = discord.utils.get(user.server.roles, name="JavaScript Helper")
            await self.client.add_roles(user, Role)
        elif reaction.message.id == ":html_css:":
            Role = discord.utils.get(user.server.roles, name="Html and Css Helper")
            await self.client.add_roles(user, Role)
            
```
ah
